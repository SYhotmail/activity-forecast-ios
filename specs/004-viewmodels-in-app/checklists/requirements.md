# Specification Quality Checklist: View Models Live in the App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-004 and FR-006 resolved 2026-11-04: test-support library in the package; app unit-test target on a simulator.
- This is an internal refactor, so the "users" are developers and reviewers. Naming the package, app, previews and tests is unavoidable and describes ownership, not implementation.
- Depends on a constitution amendment (FR-009): Principle V currently says "App holds views only".
